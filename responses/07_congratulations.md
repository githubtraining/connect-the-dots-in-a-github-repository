# Congratulations!

Great job! In this course, you've learned a lot about finding and sharing information. Within a GitHub repository, you can find history about what changes were made, and more importantly, _why_ changes were made.

If you'd like to see this project on GitHub Pages, go to the [Settings tab]({{ repoURL }}/settings) of this repository and scroll down. Then, under **GitHub Pages**, select the **`master` branch `/docs` folder** as the source.

Want to keep learning? Feel free to [check out our other courses]({{ host }}/courses).
